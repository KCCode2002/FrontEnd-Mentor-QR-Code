## My process

I always start my work with a visual breakdown of what elements I need, how I would group and position them, and then think on how to implement that.
In terms of HTML/CSS, I start by getting all my content onto the page without any styling, then focus on getting elements where I need them to be before colors or fonts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- No Frameworks or Libraries

### Continued development

In my future projects I'd like to start adding the work to Github repo's as I work, This will not only get me used to using Github but also in the case that I need help, I have the files available for anyone to see easily.
